## Once the template is deployed

### Get your database connection string and delete the service

-   Click on the service called **restart-db-then-delete-me**
-   You will see a list of deployments under the **Deployments** tab.
-   Click the most recent build's **View Logs** button.
-   Click on the **Deploy Logs** tab.
    > If the service ran correctly you should see a message in the logs that says _"All done please restart the database"_ along with your `DATABASE_URL` connection string.
-   Copy the `DATABASE_URL` connection string and save it for later.
-   Close the logs view with the **X** in the top right corner of the opened drawer.
-   Navigate to the settings tab of the `restart-db-then-delete-me` service.
-   Scroll down to the bottom and click the red **Delete Service from All Environments** button.

    > Note: If you would like to use this service and the corresponding repo to create a new Pulse project. You can by cloning the repo from your github account to your local machine.

    -   Once you have cloned the repo you can run the following command.

    ```bash
     rm -rf config
    ```

    -   Then remove the start `script: ts-node config/config-db.ts` from the `scripts` object in the `package.json` file.

    > This is to prevent the script form running everytime you push up to the repo acssociated with the **restart-db-then-delete-me** service.

### Restart your database

-   Go into your project on the railway dashboard
-   Click on the **Postgres** database
-   Navigate to the **Settings** tab
-   Click the button that says **Restart Database**

## How to connect Pulse to your database

[Link to Pulse docs](https://prismaio.notion.site/Pulse-documentation-137ca256325d4a22b80b54a89975f059?pvs=25#f241de6db85f42f5a6db7d27efbd73a1)

-   Go to your [prisma data platform dashboard](https://cloudprojects.prisma.io)
-   Click on the project you want to add Pulse to (or create a new one)
-   Click on **Configure Pulse**
-   Paste in the connection string from the railway dashboard

> The connection string can be found by clicking on the **Postgres** database and navigating to the **Connect** tab, then clicking the copy icon next to `DATABASE_URL`

Once you have done that you will need to wait for Pusle to establish the connection. This can take a few minutes.

Now you can follow [this part](https://prismaio.notion.site/Pulse-documentation-137ca256325d4a22b80b54a89975f059#e8420b42cfd24b94aa6848a2c4993855) of the Pulse documentation to get started using Pulse in your projects.
